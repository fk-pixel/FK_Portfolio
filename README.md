# [Project-2: Housing Sales Prices & Venues Data Analysis of Manchester](https://github.com/fk-pixel/Capstone-Projekt-fk-pixel/blob/master/Manchester%20Sale%20of%20House%20Suitable%20Place%20.ipynb)
-  Searching for rising locations that investors can target and professional points for new business acquisitions.
- To solve this business problem, we are going to cluster Manchester neighborhoods to suggest places where homeowners can invest in real estate and the current average property price.
- To explore and target recommended locations across different venues according to the presence of amenities and essential facilities, we will access data through FourSquare API interface and arrange them as a dataframe for visualization.
- Neighborhoods are analyzed to offer real estate for home buyers to invest.
- The k-mean clustering technique is used because it is fast and efficient in terms of computation cost.
